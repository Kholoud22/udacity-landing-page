# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

* Behavior

- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
- Add a scroll to top button on the page.
- Update/change the design.
- Make sections collapsible.
